# Part 1:

## ANOVA

We like that this group used the following code:

```{r}
pchisq(teststat,df, lower=F)
```

Instead of doing 1-pchisq. Nifty.


For lines 79, 81, and 83, include the results in hashtags, for more convienent comparisons. 

Add an abline in your regression plot. 


## Regression

Looks great.

# Part 2:

Combine scripts for part 2 into one script. 

In the ANOVA Monte carlo, delete the bottom lines to reduce reader confusion.

At the end, if time, build a graph to visually display the p-values.
